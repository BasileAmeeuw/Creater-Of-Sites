# Creator of sites project

This project has as goal to provide an open-source code of PhP for the ones who need to have a first template to elaborate a site to send products.
The sites can be cut up in two parts, one part for setting the new products to send in a JSON file and a second one to send the products with a fictitious payment device.

## Getting Started

To run this code, you have several possibilities depending of your &OS. But in the tutorial below we'll use WampServer.

### Prerequisites

For the test you will need phpUnit and you also need WampServer of a similar one as said before.
You need also to download Git if you want to follow this tutorial step by step. (but you can always used the .zip file and copy it)
